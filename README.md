### **Important Update: Introducing the New AI-Enhanced Web Tool!** üöÄ

I'm excited to announce the launch of a new, advanced Coptic Transliteration Tool that builds upon the foundations of this repository, now featuring **Google AI's Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite** model and a user-friendly web interface!

For those looking for an interactive, AI-powered experience, I've developed a dedicated web application. Additionally, I have transitioing the rule-based approach away from using Pynini to simplify the implementation. You can also access that on the new GitHub repository linked below.

---

**Key Features of the New AI-Enhanced Tool:**

* **‚ú® AI-Powered Transliteration:** Utilizes **Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite** for more contextual and nuanced transliterations, offering higher accuracy for complex texts.
* **üåê Web-Based Interface:** An intuitive Streamlit application accessible directly in your browser, no local setup required after deployment.
* **üöÄ Easy to Use:** Simply paste your Coptic text or upload a file, and get instant transliterations.
* **ü§ù Hybrid Approach:** Still includes the robust rule-based transliterator as a fallback and for comparison.

**üëâ Access the New Tool:**

You can find the new project and its deployed version here:

* **GitHub Repository:** [shehatamichael/coptic-transliterator-llm](https://github.com/shehatamichael/coptic-transliterator-llm)
* **Live Application:** (https://coptic-transliterator-llm.streamlit.app/)

## Coptic Transliteration Tool

The vision of this project is to provide an easy, bulk transliteration service between Coptic and Latin script. The primary use case (Coptic --> Latin script) is to allow English speakers who do not read Coptic to follow along with church services by offering transliterated text with accurate and transparent pronunciations.

üöß ***This script is a work-in-progress and updates will be made regularly to support more rules*** üöß

## Disclaimer

This tool is still in development and we are working on expanding this as fast as we can. This tool supports 1-to-1 mapping for all Coptic letters. Special environement (1:Multiple mapping) is currently supported for the following letters:

Alpha -- ‚≤Å\
Veeta -- ‚≤É\
Gamma -- ‚≤Ö\
Ei -- ‚≤â\
Eeta -- ‚≤è

## About the Transliterator

1) Accepts a single text file as input
2) Transforms a copy of the input file into Latin script using rule-based character mappings (implemented in Python)
3) Outputs the transformed copy of the input file (text file output format)

## Pre-requisites to run this script

* Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

* Once you have installed Miniconda, you will be able to install packages using the `conda` command. Run the following command to install the Pynini package which is used in developing this tool

>```sh
>conda install -c conda-forge pynini
>```
 
üö® **Note:** Having troubles installing Pynini? Try again after creating a new Conda environment:

>```sh
>conda create --name coptic
>conda update --all
>conda install --name coptic -c conda-forge pynini
>```

## Installation

- This script is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/coptictranslit/)
>```sh
>pip install coptictranslit
>```

## Usage

* After successfull installation. Simply type this command in your shell/terminal after making the necessary changes and follow the prompt:
>```sh
>python3 -m translit.coptictranslit *insert your Coptic text file path here*
>```
