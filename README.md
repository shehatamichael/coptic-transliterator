## Coptic Transliteration Tool

The vision of this project is to provide an easy, bulk transliteration service between Coptic and Latin script. The primary use case (Coptic --> Latin script) is to allow English speakers who do not read Coptic to follow along with church services by offering transliterated text with accurate and transparent pronunciations.

üöß ***This script is a work-in-progress and updates will be made regularly to support more rules*** üöß

## Disclaimer

This tool is still in development and we are working on expanding this as fast as we can. This tool supports 1-to-1 mapping for all Coptic letters. Special environement (1:Multiple mapping) is currently supported for the following letters:

Alpha -- ‚≤Å\
Veeta -- ‚≤É\
Gamma -- ‚≤Ö\
Ei -- ‚≤â\
Eeta -- ‚≤è
